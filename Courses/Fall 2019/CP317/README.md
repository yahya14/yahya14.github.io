### A list of project members containing their last names, first names, WLU email addresses, and GitHub (or other versioning product) user name. The list must be in order by last name, first name.

#### 3. Specific requirements 

### An informal specification document  

### Deliverable Objectives/Requirements Qualities

#### Keep in mind that key objectives of a requirements document are to: 
* Document the customer's needs
* Identify functional capabilities to be provided
* Identify non-functional and environmental constraints that must be satisfied
* Provide a definitive basis for testing and verification
* Identify lifecycle considerations such as incremental sub-system development
* Provide a reference tool readable by customer, developer, and maintainer
* Serve as a contract between customer and developer


#### In addition, keep in mind that a requirements document should possess the following qualities:

* Complete: everything that is essential is described
* Understandable: the "customer" can read it and be convinced that all his objectives and needs are adequately and accurately described
* Utility: the information in the document can be used effectively to help in the design phase (e.g., an OO requirements analysis can aid in development of an OO design)
* Unambiguous: every reader will come away with the same understanding
* Consistent: no contradictions
* Abstract: one model, many realizations, and no implementation details
* Feasible: the requirements can be satisfied within resource constraints
* Even: the entire document is at same level of detail
* Effectively modifiable: this is a living document
* Concise and appropriate: no extraneous details and not more than required
* Verifiable and testable: you can tell when you've met the requirements
